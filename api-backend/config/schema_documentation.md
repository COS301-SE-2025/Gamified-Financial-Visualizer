## 🧾 Table: `point_rules`
Defines the system’s point-awarding rules for various gamified actions. Used to centrally manage how many points are given for each activity.

| Column Name    | Data Type     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rule_id`      | SERIAL        | Primary key. Unique ID for the rule.                                        |
| `action_type`  | VARCHAR(50)   | The type of user action. Must be one of: `transaction`, `goal_created`, `goal_completed`, `quiz_completed`, `achievement_unlocked`, `challenge_completed`. |
| `base_points`  | INT           | Number of points to award for the action. Must be ≥ 0.                      |

> This table allows the backend to dynamically retrieve and apply point rules without hardcoding logic. It supports scalable and adjustable gamification systems.

## 🗑️ Delete Rules Strategy (`ON DELETE` Behavior)

To preserve data integrity and avoid orphaned records, the schema uses carefully selected `ON DELETE` rules on foreign key relationships. These rules dictate what happens to dependent records when a parent record is deleted.

### 🔧 Purpose of Delete Rules

- **`ON DELETE CASCADE`**: Automatically deletes child records when the parent is deleted.
- **`ON DELETE SET NULL`**: Retains the child record but nullifies the reference if the parent is removed.
- **No Rule (Default)**: Prevents deletion of parent if child rows exist (`RESTRICT` behavior).

---

### ✅ Key Applications

#### `users`  
- **CASCADE** on:
  - `accounts`
  - `user_tokens`
  - `user_preferences`
  - `user_push_subscriptions`
  - `custom_categories`
  - `goals`
  - `goal_progress`
  - `quiz_attempts`
  - `user_achievements`
  - `user_points`
  - `points_log`
  - `community_members`
  - `friendships`
  - `ai_scores`
  - `visual_assets`
  - `ar_scene_state`
  
  > Ensures that deleting a user removes all their associated records cleanly.

#### `accounts`
- **CASCADE** on `transactions`  
  > Deleting an account also removes all its transactions.

#### `budgets`
- **CASCADE** on `budget_categories`  
  > Removes budget allocations when the parent budget is deleted.

#### `transactions`
- **SET NULL** on:
  - `budget_id`
  - `linked_goal_id`
  - `linked_challenge_id`
  
  > Keeps transaction history even if associated goal/challenge is removed.

#### `transactions`
- **CASCADE** on `recurring_transactions`  
  > Automatically removes recurring metadata if the base transaction is deleted.

#### `goals`
- **CASCADE** on `goal_progress`  
  > Removes all contributions if the goal is deleted.

#### `communities`
- **CASCADE** on:
  - `community_members`
  - `challenge_progress`
  - `leaderboard_entries`
  
  > Prevents orphaned records in community-related tables.

#### `learning_modules`
- **CASCADE** on:
  - `lessons`
  - `quizzes`
  
  > Ensures module deletion removes all linked content.

#### `quizzes`
- **CASCADE** on `quiz_attempts`  
  > Removes attempts if the quiz is deleted.

---

### 🔒 Summary of Best Practices

- Use **CASCADE** when child records lose meaning without the parent (e.g., goal progress, transactions).
- Use **SET NULL** when historical data must remain but without reference (e.g., transactions linked to removed goals).
- Avoid ambiguous defaults; always define an explicit rule when creating foreign keys.

## 🧠 Indexing Strategy

To ensure efficient data retrieval and maintain optimal performance, strategic indexes have been added to frequently queried columns across the schema. These indexes reduce lookup time for large datasets, especially in user-centric and transactional operations.

### 🔍 Why Indexing Matters

Indexes improve the speed of:
- Searching and filtering (`WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`)
- Enforcing uniqueness (`UNIQUE`, `PRIMARY KEY`)
- Sorting and aggregations (`GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`)

However, indexes also slightly increase storage usage and insert/update costs — so they are applied selectively where performance gains justify the tradeoff.

---

### ✅ Key Indexes

#### Users
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
```

> Speeds up login lookups, username/email validation, and authentication.

#### Accounts
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_accounts_user_id ON accounts(user_id);
```

> Efficient retrieval of user accounts.

#### Transactions
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_account_id ON transactions(account_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_user_type_date ON transactions(transaction_type, transaction_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_category_id ON transactions(category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_custom_category_id ON transactions(custom_category_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_transactions_budget_id ON transactions(budget_id);
```

> Optimizes filtering by account, category, type, and date for dashboards, budgets, and reports.

#### Goals & Progress
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_user_id ON goals(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_goals_goal_status ON goals(goal_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_goal_progress_goal_id ON goal_progress(goal_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_goal_progress_contributor_id ON goal_progress(contributor_id);
```

> Enhances performance on user goals overview and progress calculations.

#### Quizzes & Attempts
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_quiz_attempts_user_id ON quiz_attempts(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_quiz_attempts_quiz_id ON quiz_attempts(quiz_id);
```

> Useful for retrieving quiz history and statistics per user/module.

#### Budgets
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_budgets_user_id ON budgets(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_budget_categories_budget_id ON budget_categories(budget_id);
```

> Speeds up fetching budgets and category allocations tied to users.

#### Achievements
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_user_achievements_user_id ON user_achievements(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_achievements_achievement_id ON user_achievements(achievement_id);
```

> Fast access to user achievement records and badge assignment.


ℹ️ Best Practice: All indexes are non-unique unless needed for constraints. They are designed to support core application features like dashboard rendering, financial calculations, leaderboards, and gamification logic.
